TODO Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.
TODO User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
TODO User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
TODO User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
TODO User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
TODO User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
TODO User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
TODO User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").
TODO User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
TODO User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.
TODO You can build your project by forking this CodePen pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js.
