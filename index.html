                    Leslie Lamport is an American computer scientist and mathematician who is known for his work on fault tolerant distributed systems. He developed the Bakery Algorithm, which places concurrent processes into an
                    implicit queue based on order of arrival.

                    <br>
                    The Bakery Algorithm laid the foundation for his continued work in distributed systems, which was highlighted by concepts such as, loop-freedom, sequential consistency,
                    logical clocks, and atomic/regular registers. The bulk of Leslie's work, and arguably his most important work, dealt with fault tolerance for distributed systems.
                    Two concepts formed the cornerstone for his fault tolerance work, which were state machine replication and byzantine agreement.

                    Those cornerstones went on to support the culmination of his work, represented in the Paxos Algorithm, which has become the gold standard for
                    designing consensus and replication distributed systems. Given these contributions, it's a fair statement that modern computing would not be where it is today without Leslie Lamport.
